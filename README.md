# ww-multithreading


Whats done so far is when the user types in "./ww -r 10 "somefiledirectory" it will go to that directory and word wrap the text, but if there is a dirctory in the directory
it has a problem where some of the file gets moved to the second sub directory, need to add a way to ignore subdirectories itself from beign wraped



now i was thinking to use a function to replace what i coded, so it could be done recursivley 
--will look at this in a few hours.
